[!INCLUDE [Header](../../common/javascript.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Introduction](intro.md)]

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [Prerequisites](../../common/azure-prerequisites.md)]

You also need a *.wav* audio file on your local machine. You can use your own *.wav* file (up to 30 seconds) or download the [https://crbn.us/whatstheweatherlike.wav](https://crbn.us/whatstheweatherlike.wav) sample file.

## Set up the environment

Before you can do anything, you need to install the Speech SDK for JavaScript. Run this command: `npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk`. For guided installation instructions, see [Install the Speech SDK](../../../quickstarts/setup-platform.md?pivots=programming-language-javascript).

### Set environment variables

Using the terminal (as per the specified Operating System)

[!INCLUDE [Environment variables](../../common/environment-variables.md)]

You can alternatively create  a .env file in the root directory of your project and paste these environmental varibales in the file, this will later on require you to install the dotenv npm package.

```console
SPEECH_KEY=<speech_service_api_key>
SPEECH_REGION=<azure_resource_region e.g. eastus>
```

## Recognize speech from a file

Follow these steps to create a Node.js console application for speech recognition.

1. Open a command prompt where you want the new project, and create a new file named *SpeechRecognition.js*.
1. Initialize npm in your project, then install dotenv(if you are going to use the .env file) as a development dependency:

   ```console
   npm init -y
   npm i dotenv -D
   ```
1. Install the Speech SDK for JavaScript:

   ```console
   npm install microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk
   ```

1. Copy the following code into *SpeechRecognition.js*:

   ```javascript
   //import dotenv package if you are using the .env file
   const dotenv = require('dotenv').config()
   
   const fs = require("fs");
   const sdk = require("microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk");

   // This example requires environment variables named "SPEECH_KEY" and "SPEECH_REGION"
   const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription(process.env.SPEECH_KEY, process.env.SPEECH_REGION);
   speechConfig.speechRecognitionLanguage = "en-US";
   ```
   
1. You can choose to implement speech recognition using a switch statement by adding the code shown below;
   ```javascript
   function fromFile() {
       let audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput(fs.readFileSync("YourAudioFile.wav")); //add the path to your .wav file
       let speechRecognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);

       speechRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(result => {
           switch (result.reason) {
               case sdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech:
                   console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text=${result.text}`);
                   break;
               case sdk.ResultReason.NoMatch:
                   console.log("NOMATCH: Speech could not be recognized.");
                   break;
               case sdk.ResultReason.Canceled:
                   const cancellation = sdk.CancellationDetails.fromResult(result);
                   console.log(`CANCELED: Reason=${cancellation.reason}`);

                   if (cancellation.reason == sdk.CancellationReason.Error) {
                       console.log(`CANCELED: ErrorCode=${cancellation.ErrorCode}`);
                       console.log(`CANCELED: ErrorDetails=${cancellation.errorDetails}`);
                       console.log("CANCELED: Did you set the speech resource key and region values?");
                   }
                   break;
           }
           speechRecognizer.close();
       });
   }
   fromFile();
   ```
   
1. Or you can implement the same using an asynchronous function as show below.
   ```javascript
   const fromFile = async () =>{
       try{
       const speechConfig = sdk.SpeechConfig.fromSubscription(process.env.SPEECH_KEY, process.env.SPEECH_REGION);
       speechConfig.speechRecognitionLanguage = `en-US`;
       let audioConfig = sdk.AudioConfig.fromWavFileInput(fs.readFileSync(`YourAudioFile.wav`)); //add the path to your .wav file
       let speechRecognizer = new sdk.SpeechRecognizer(speechConfig, audioConfig);
   
       const result = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {speechRecognizer.recognizeOnceAsync(resolve, reject);});
       if(result.reason == sdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) console.log(`RECOGNIZED: Text = ${result.text}`); //this is convenient for only getting the text  
       else if(result.reason !== sdk.ResultReason.RecognizedSpeech) console.log(`Sorry but couldn't get what you said.`);
       speechRecognizer.close();  
       }
       catch (error) {console.log(error)}
   }
   fromFile()
   ```

1. In *SpeechRecognition.js*, replace *YourAudioFile.wav* with your own *.wav* file. This example only recognizes speech from a *.wav* file. For information about other audio formats, see [How to use compressed input audio](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-use-codec-compressed-audio-input-streams.md). This example supports up to 30 seconds of audio.
1. To change the speech recognition language, replace `en-US` with another [supported language](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-support.md). For example, use `es-ES` for Spanish (Spain). If you don't specify a language, the default is `en-US`. For details about how to identify one of multiple languages that might be spoken, see [Language identification](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/language-identification.md).

1. Run your new console application to start speech recognition from a file:

   ```console
   node SpeechRecognition
   ```

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure that you set the `SPEECH_KEY` and `SPEECH_REGION` environment variables as described in [Set environment variables](#set-environment-variables). If you don't set these variables, the sample fails with an error message.

   The speech from the audio file should be output as text:

   ```output
   RECOGNIZED: Text=I'm excited to try speech to text.
   ```

## Remarks

This example uses the `recognizeOnceAsync` operation to transcribe utterances of up to 30 seconds, or until silence is detected. For information about continuous recognition for longer audio, including multi-lingual conversations, see [How to recognize speech](~/articles/ai-services/speech-service/how-to-recognize-speech.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Recognizing speech from a microphone is not supported in Node.js. It's supported only in a browser-based JavaScript environment. For more information, see the [React sample](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample) and the [implementation of speech to text from a microphone](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/AzureSpeechReactSample/blob/main/src/App.js#L29) on GitHub.
> 
> The React sample shows design patterns for the exchange and management of authentication tokens. It also shows the capture of audio from a microphone or file for speech to text conversions.
